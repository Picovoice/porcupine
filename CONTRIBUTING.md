## Ideas for Contributing

* Adding new language/platform bindings. When adding a new binding please do make sure it is tested. Adding
accompanying unit test is a great way to assure that. Take a look at [binding/python/](/binding/python) to find out how
to unit test new bindings.

* Adding new demos. Feel free to add new demos showcasing Porcupine's capabilities on new platforms. Even better,
if you have a cool application idea using Porcupine feel free to add it under [demo/](/demo).

* Adding tutorials. Step-by-step tutorials are a great way of sharing knowledge with the community. These are extremely
helpful especially when some hardware setup is involved (e.g. Raspberry Pi project).
