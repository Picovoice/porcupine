# Porcupine Rust Demos

This Rust module contains demos for processing real-time audio (i.e. microphone) and audio files using the Porcupine wake word engine.

## Usage

NOTE: The working directory for the following `Cargo` commands is:

```console
porcupine/demo/rust/filedemo  # File Demo
porcupine/demo/rust/micdemo  # Microphone Demo
```

## AccessKey

Porcupine requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Porcupine SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

### File Demo

The file demo uses Porcupine to scan for keywords in a `.wav` file.
The demo is mainly useful for quantitative performance benchmarking against a corpus of audio data.
Porcupine processes a 16kHz, single-channel audio stream.
The following processes a file looking for instances of the phrase "Picovoice":

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --input_audio_path "path/to/input.wav" --keywords picovoice
```

`keywords` is a shorthand for using default keyword files shipped with the package. The list of default keyword files
can be seen in the usage string:

```console
cargo run --release -- --help
```

To detect multiple phrases concurrently provide them as comma-separated values.
If the wake word is more than a single word, surround the argument in quotation marks:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --input_audio_path "path/to/input.wav" --keywords picovoice,grasshopper,"hey siri"
```

To detect non-default keywords (e.g. models created using [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/))
use `keyword_paths` argument:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} \
--input_audio_path "path/to/input.wav" \
--keyword_paths "/path/to/keyword/one.ppn","/path/to/keyword/two.ppn"
```

The sensitivity of the engine can be tuned per keyword using the `sensitivities` input argument:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} \
--input_audio_path "path/to/input.wav" \
--keywords grasshopper,porcupine --sensitivities 0.3,0.6
```

Sensitivity is the parameter that enables trading miss rate for the false alarm rate.
It is a floating point number within `[0, 1]`.
A higher sensitivity reduces the miss rate at the cost of increased false alarm rate.

### Microphone Demo

The microphone opens an audio stream from a microphone and detects utterances of a given wake word.
The following opens the default microphone and detects occurrences of "Picovoice":

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --keywords picovoice
```

`keywords` is a shorthand for using default keyword files shipped with the package.
The list of default keyword files can be seen in the usage string:

```console
cargo run --release -- --help
```

To detect multiple phrases concurrently provide them as comma-separated values.
If the wake word is more than a single word, surround the argument in quotation marks:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --keywords picovoice,grasshopper,"hey siri"
```

To detect non-default keywords (e.g. models created using [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/))
use the `keyword_paths` argument:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --keyword_paths "/path/to/keyword/one.ppn","/path/to/keyword/two.ppn"
```

It is possible that the default audio input device is not the one you wish to use. There are a couple
of debugging facilities baked into the demo application to solve this. First, type the following into the console:

```console
cargo run --release -- --show_audio_devices
```

It provides information about various audio input devices on the box. Here is an example output:

```console
index: 0, device name: USB Audio Device
index: 1, device name: MacBook Air Microphone
``` 

You can use the device index to specify which microphone to use for the demo. For instance, if you want to use the USB Audio Device
in the above example, you can invoke the demo application as below:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --keywords picovoice --audio_device_index 0
```

If the problem persists we suggest storing the recorded audio into a file for inspection.
This can be achieved with:

```console
cargo run --release -- --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --keywords picovoice --output_path ./test.wav
```

If after listening to stored file there is no apparent problem detected please open an issue.
