# porcupine-web-react-demo

This demo application includes the `VoiceWidget` which uses the `usePorcupine` react hook to allow listening for keywords. The keywords are handled via the `keywordEventHandler` callback function that updates a React `useState` hook, and then renders the results.

If you decline microphone permission in the browser, or another such issue prevents Porcupine from starting, the error will be displayed.

The widget shows the various loading and error states, as well as mounting/unmounting the `VoiceWidget` with a toggle, demonstrating the complete lifecycle of Porcupine with in a React app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## AccessKey

Porcupine requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using
Porcupine SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Install and Run

Use `yarn` or `npm` to install the dependencies, and the `start` script with a language code
to start a local web server hosting the demo in the language of your choice (e.g. `de` -> German, `ko` -> Korean).
To see a list of available languages, run `start` without a language code.

```console
yarn
yarn start ${LANGUAGE}
```

(or)

```console
npm install
npm run start ${LANGUAGE}
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Enter your access key and press on `Init Porcupine` to start recording
for keyword detections.
