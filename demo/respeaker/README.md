# Porcupine ReSpeaker Demo

Made in Vancouver, Canada by [Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai)

This package contains a commandline demo for controlling ReSpeaker 4-mic microphone array LEDs using Porcupine.

## Porcupine

Porcupine is a highly-accurate and lightweight wake word engine. It enables building always-listening voice-enabled
applications. It is

- using deep neural networks trained in real-world environments.
- compact and computationally-efficient. It is perfect for IoT.
- cross-platform:
  - Arm Cortex-M, STM32, PSoC, Arduino, and i.MX RT 
  - Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and BeagleBone
  - Android and iOS
  - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
  - Linux (x86_64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), and Windows (x86_64)
- scalable. It can detect multiple always-listening voice commands with no added runtime footprint.
- self-service. Developers can train custom wake word models using [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/).

## Installation

Follow the instructions on [Seeed Studio](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array_for_Raspberry_Pi/)
to install and set up the microphone array.

Then install the demo:

```console
sudo pip3 install ppnrespeakerdemo
```

## AccessKey

Porcupine requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Porcupine SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Usage

Below are the colors associated with supported wake words for this demo:
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
- ![#ffff33](../../resources/images/ffff33.png) `Alexa`
- ![#ff8000](../../resources/images/ff8000.png) `Bumblebee`
- ![#ffffff](../../resources/images/ffffff.png) `Computer`
- ![#ff0000](../../resources/images/ff0000.png) `Hey Google`
- ![#800080](../../resources/images/800080.png) `Hey Siri`
- ![#ff3399](../../resources/images/ff3399.png) `Jarvis`
- ![#00ff00](../../resources/images/00ff00.png) `Picovoice`
- ![#0000ff](../../resources/images/0000ff.png) `Porcupine`
- ![#000000](../../resources/images/000000.png) `Terminator`
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
Run the demo:

```console
porcupine_respeaker_demo --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY}
```

Wait for the demo to initialize and print `[Listening]` in the terminal. Say:

> Picovoice

The demo outputs:

```text
detected 'Picovoice'
```

The lights are now set to `green`. Say:

> Alexa

The lights are set to `yellow` now. Say:

> Terminator

to turn off the lights.
